Assignment:1
- Create a  new class as "MyMobile"
- create variables for the class
- Create 2 public methods (makeCall() , sendMsg()) with simple print statement
- Create a private method payBills() with simple print statement
- Create main method
- Create object for "MyMobile" class and call the methods and variables using the object
- Execute the class and get the result in console
Assignment:2
Goal: To understand the object, method and return type.

a) Create a class by name: Chrome (with no main method) in same package
b) Create a method by name: getName()
c) Print a statement inside the method --> "This is google chrome"
d) Call the method getName() from class: Browser using object reference
e) Run Browser class and Confirm the printed in console
Assignment: 3
Goal:To understand  ( Class and Methods)

       Create a class "Calculator" with below methods
	(a) add(int num1, int num2, int num3), it should return sum of num1+num2+num3
	(b) sub(int num1, int num2), it should return subtraction of of num1-num2
	(c) mul(double num1, double num2), it should return product of num1 * num2
	(d) divide(float num1, float num2), it should return division of num1 / num2

-- Create another class as MyCalculator and call all the methods from Calculator and print the results

Assignment4 : Print if the given number is odd or even

Goal: To understand the mod operator(%), conditional statement and logic writing

a) Create a class by name: OddOrEven
b) Create a main method using shortcut
c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
d) Write a logic to print if the given input is odd or even

Hint: Divide the given input by 2 and if the remainder is 0 -> even else odd. 
Use mod (%) operator to find remainder

Assignment 5:
Goal: To find whether a number is a Prime number or not
	 * input: 13
	 * output: 13 is a Prime Number
// Declare an int Input and assign a value 13

// Declare a boolean variable flag as false

// Iterate from 2 to half of the input

// Divide the input with each for loop variable and check the remainder

// Set the flag as true when there is no remainder

// break the iterator

// Check the flag (Provide a condition)

// Print 'Prime' when the condition matches

// Print 'Not a Prime' when the condition doesn't match 

Assignment 6:
Goal: CheckIfTheNumberIsPositiveOrNegative 

	
	Problem statement: Check if the number is positive or negative
        / *Pseudocode
	 * : ---------- 
	 * 1. Initialize a number, say, int number= 35; 
	 * 
	 * 2. If a number is positive, print "The number is positive" 
	 * 
	 * If a number is negative, print "The number is negative" 
	 * 
	 * If it nether negative nor positive, print as
	 * 
	 * "The number is neither positive nor negative"
	 */
Assignment 7:
Goal: Convert A Negative Number To PositiveNumber 

	/*
	*Problem statement: Convert a negative number to positive number
	 * Pseudocode: 
	 * 
	 * 1. Initialize an integer with a negative number like,
	 * int number = -40;
	 * 2. Check if the number is a negative number 
	 * Hint : any number that is lesser than zero is a negative number 
	 * 3. If so, convert the number to a positive number
	 * 4. Print the converted positive number
Assignment 8:
Goal: Find the odd numbers in the specific range of numbers
	 * 
	 * Input: range of numbers (starting to end) [1 to 20]
	 * Output: Printing only odd numbers [1,3,5,7,9...,19]
          System.out.println("Printing only the odd numbers from 1 to 20");

		//	Iterate from 1 to 20 (tip: using loop concept)

		//	Within loop -> check whether the integer is odd (tip: use mod operator % )

		//	Within loop -> print the odd integer
